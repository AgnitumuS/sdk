Mautilus Smart TV SDK™
===========

### 1. Introduction

Smart TV applications become more and more popular around the globe. In some parts of the world, the number of people watching video on smart TVs significantly exceeds the number of people, who use mobile phones and tablets for video streaming due to expensive data tariffs, limitations of 3G and LTE connection bandwidth, and data caps.

Mautilus is the biggest design and development house for smart TV applications in Europe with a track of applications installed on all continents (except Antarctica:). We cooperate closely with all major TV, set-top box and game console manufacturers in order to produce the best quality applications for every platform our customers request.
 
Our applications are based on our open source and BSD licensed cross-platform Mautilus Smart TV SDK™. Using the SDK, the applications are developed only once, and thanks to drivers dynamically loaded from the SDK, they can be installed and run on any TV platform.
 
Applications based on Mautilus Smart TV SDK™ share the same source code across all platforms. That approach enormously reduces the effort required for the application development and simplifies the long-term maintenance.
